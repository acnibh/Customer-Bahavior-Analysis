# CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
## Introduction
A store who sell their products on the ecommmerce platform such as Tiki, Lazada, Shopee, etc. The had just achieved 10 billions VND for gross revenue and they want to double gross revenue at 20 billions in the next month. This project used a part of data from their sample customer order and Google Analytics. I found that the store should focus on launching effectively campaigns on Google, Youtube, Facebook and their website in the mid-week and mid-month.

### Tool
- Python (import data, cleaning data, analysis)
